Use case. Late into sorting, starting catalog. Today
I recognized the opportunity to consolidate spatially
significant collections of networking things into one
place. I'll recursively merge, sort, and catalog the
stuff I have in a few places, including a section of
shelves opposite the workbench.

At the top level, I'll create a single new box to hold
the whole collection of things that come out, under the
main heading of networking equipment. We'll need a cat
entry to start.
